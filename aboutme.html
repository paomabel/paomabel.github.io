		<h2>About Me...</h2>
		<p>Hey there! My name is Paola and this is my website! I was born in Monterrey, Mexico and moved to the U.S at a very young age. My family and I first moved to California but only lasted there about 6 months. 
		  From California we moved to Houston, Texas where we have lived ever since!. We moved around in different areas of Houston until we finally settled down in Katy.
		There, I attended many different public schools, participating in their bilingual programs where I learned to read and write in Spanish and English. Then, one day my parents got a letter in the mail, detailing about a new school that was going to be built by my house.
		Considering my brother and I had never truly felt comfortable in public school, the small classroom and more teacher to student interaction that was being offered in this school became appealing to my parents.
		As soon as the school opened, my brother and I were immediately transferred. Nine year old me was a bit skeptical at first but I ended up loving it.
		At this new school, I was able to develop socially,academically and culturally. It was a STEM based school, so I grew up constantly doing STEM projects, something I found very appealing.
		I began to learn about coding at 12 years old, learning about HTML, which is where my passion for coding began. A lot of admin and teachers in the school were from Turkey, and they also offered Turkish as 
		a language, so I took the opportunity to learn Turkish and I was also able to learn about the beautiful culture through my interactions with my teachers.
		Coming highschool, I continued to explore my interest in coding through the PLTW Computer Science pathway that was offered at my school.
		My first official coding language that I learned was Python. At the end of my freshman year, I also created a project through the funding of my school, in which
		I made a small trashcan robot using VEX robotics parts and a Raspberry Pi to code it and connect it to a Wiimote with Bluetooth. I also joined the FIRST Tech Challenge robotics team at my 
		highschool, where the first year I was a builder. However, my second year in robotics I switched to being my teams programmer, we also made it to Super Regionals that year.
		My sophomore year I also created another project where I used an arduino and electromyography sensors to create game controllers so you could play video games with your muscles!
		Junior year, I found out more about other areas in the Computer Science field and took an interest in CyberSecurity. I talked to my Computer Science teacher about it
		and we formed a CyberPatriot team. I was in charge of handling the vulnerabilities within the Windows VM.</p>
