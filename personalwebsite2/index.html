                            I'm currently a senior at Texas A&M University studying Computer Science. This past summer I interned at Texas Instruments
                            where I worked as a Full-Stack Application Developer and also dabbled in the world of project management. Last year, I served as 
                            the Director of Technical Affairs for the SHPE Chapter at Texas A&M. I got the amazing opportunity to lead alongside amazing people
                            and was able to help others in the community. I hope to continue being active and helping others. As for career development, I'm currently
                            seeking a full-time job in Software Engineering, but I'm also open to Software Development, or Data Analytics. Although most of my work has been 
                            front-end or full-stack, I have keen interest in Machine Learning and AI, I'm always open to continue learning! Thanks and Gig 'em.

                                    The Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, SHPE for short, is the largest association
                                    in the United States for Hispanics in STEM. It has chapters nationwide, all with one mission:
                                    empower Hispanics to each their fullest potential through volunteering, mentorship and workshops, 
                                    amongst other events.

                                    I joined SHPE my first semester of college but it wasn't until my second semester that I was truly active.
                                    My second semester I joined the Tech Affairs Committee, worked on my personal website on my own time and tried
                                    to go to as many events/workshops that I could. This past year is when I truly began engaging, I've attended many 
                                    events and workshops, and also became more active in the Tech Affairs Committee. In the fall, I got the amazing 
                                    opportunity to attend National Convention, where I was able to network, attend workshops and meet with companies.
                                    At National Convention, I was fortunate enough to get my second internship offer at Cummins. This semester I was also
                                    given the amazing opportunity to work alongside other SHPEsters in order to organize our very first SHPEathon. We met 
                                    as frequently as we could and I gave ideas as to how we could organize this event so it could go as smoothly as it did.

                                    Aggie Women In Computer Science, or AWICS, is an organization that strives to connect young women to 
                                    the field of Computer Science. They provide to their members a tight-knit community filled with hard-working 
                                    women in Computer Science.
                                    
                                    In AWICS, I have been able to attend some of their workshop in order to help develop my professional career.
                                    For example, some of their workshops have allowed me to better my resume so that flows more smoothly. I have
                                    also attended some of their socials and meetings with companies in which I have learned first-hand what the 
                                    field is truly like especially as a woman in Computer Science.

                                    POSSE is found in major cities across the US. Each city has different partner schools, Texas
                                    A&M is a partner school for Houston and Atlanta. Only four students from each school in each city can be nominated. These students then
                                    have to undergo three separate rounds of interviews. The first and last interview are group interviews, while the second is a solo. In the group
                                    interviews, the students are carefully watched, rated on their ability to support, work and lead others. By the third interview, there is only
                                    about 25 students left, and only 10 are chosen. These 10 students then become each others support system throughout college and are awarded full
                                    tuition scholarships. These students are also expected to attend weekly meetings, workshops and check ins with their mentor. POSSE students are expected to thrive and become leaders in 
                                    their respective community.

                                        In this 11 week internship, I was able to really dive into the culture of TI and see the different
                                        aspects that they had to offer as a company. During my time there, I scheduled meetings with different people
                                        on my team in order to learn the role that they played within the team and what the team as a whole did. As for my
                                        actual work, I designed and implemented a form within their IT Service Management (ITSM) tool in order to efficiently
                                        gather ticket metrics for the root causes that tickets were being submitted. I also developed a full-stack component that
                                        worked in cohesion with the form I implemented with their ITSM tool. This application used the MVC framework, with C#, .NET,
                                        JavaScript as an ITSM API they used. While completing these two components, I was also responsible for setting up meetings
                                        with my stakeholder in order to test the functionality and receive feedback on the application.

                                        I was at HPE for about a year where I got to work on front-end development. In this year-long internship, it was 
                                        a remote position but nonetheless I was able to meet my team and ask them about their careers and their roles on 
                                        team. During my time here, I worked on upgrading a framework that the team used on their main application, by upgrading
                                        this it allowed the application to be able to implement new features and still be compatible with other frameworks they
                                        used within it. I got to work on a virtual machine but then switched over to a local version and learned about Docker Containers.

                                        Participated in a 6-week long program in which the first 3 weeks were dedicated to learning about
                                        Machine Learning, the different types of algorithms and the types of bias' that may apply. From the
                                        beginning we were put into groups of four and were to come up with a research question. My team and I
                                        wanted to respond to "How has COVID-19 positively affected the environment?", we used a Linear Regression
                                        Model to respond to our question. Our results were very innaccurate as we failed to take into account the
                                        many different types of bias' that affected each individual city.

                                        Worked with the OMDb API in order to create a website in which you could search up any 
                                        movie and the user would be able to see the important details of the movie, such as the 
                                        movie poster,director, cast etc. Once you searched up the movie, on the webpage you would
                                        be able to see the first 10 results on the first page. I implemented the API with HMTL,CSS 
                                        and JSON, it was a super fun project as it was my first time working with an API.

                                        I've participated twice in Howdy Hack. My first time, my team and I developed a 
                                        website in which students could find a tutor that could accommodate to their specific
                                        needs. For example, if a student was looking for someone that was available on specific 
                                        days/hours or if they had a limited price range, the user was able to filter the tutors
                                        according to their needs. We used HTML,JSON and CSS to implement it. The second time, I 
                                        came up with the idea to make a game that could help users learn an instrument while playing
                                        a mini game. The user would see the specific notes on the screen and they would have to press
                                        down those keys on their keyboard, which would then play that sound while moving the character
                                        on the screen. It had two instruments, piano and guitar. We used Python and the Pygame Python
                                        Library.

                                        Through joining the Tech Affairs Committee, I was able to work on my own personal
                                        website in order to showcase my portfolio. The first website I made I implemented
                                        HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. Unfortunately, I was not very happy with the end result 
                                        so I decided to change it. The website you're currently on is my second version and
                                        it was made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

                                        I completed this project my freshman year of highschool. I used a Raspberry Pi for the
                                        software development part of this projects. I used Python and Bluetooth connection in order
                                        to connect the program to a Wiimote, which in turn moved the robot. To build the chasis I used
                                        VEX Robotics parts and I modified a small trash bin to make its body.

                                        I used an Arduino Uno to implement this project, alongside muscle sensors. My partner and I
                                        coded the muscle sensor so that once it was attached to a bicep or tricep it would allow the
                                        user to move a character in a game. For our demo we used one of the Pokemon games and we had
                                        to study about electromyography in order to understand how to code the sensors.

                                        I want the members of my committee to see our meetings as a way to destress and work on things
                                        outside of school work in which they can apply their major while building their resume. I hope
                                        to be able to get funds so that I can divide my members into teams and let them work on a project
                                        of their choice. By doing this it will allow them to work on their team building skills as well. If
                                        they decide they don't want to work in a team, they will have the option to work on their personal website
                                        or they could also just hang out and get to know their fellow SHPEsters. I hope to work with the treasurer
                                        in order to create fundraisers so that we have the adequate funds to get the materials for these projects.
                                        I also hope to host a SHPEathon for our members each semester, that way they can showcase their work at the
                                        first career fair or if they join SHPE at a later point in the semester they still have the opportunity to 
                                        participate.

                                        be a very interesting field, I really enjoyed what I was learning when I did the AI4ALL
                                        College Pathways program in the summer. I'd also like to live somewhere in Europe at one 
                                        point in my life and teach myself a couple of languges. Some of the languages in the list 
                                        include: French, Arabic, and German. I'd like to finish learning Turkish as well :)
